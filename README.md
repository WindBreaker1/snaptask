# SnapTask

SnapTask is a simple app based on the concept of 'eat the frog', popularized by Brian Tracy, in his book, 'Eat that frog!'.

The idea is that if the first thing you do each morning is to eat a live frog, you can continue knowing that it's probably the worst thing that's going to happen to you that day.

However, it can be hard to find a frog to eat, so SnapTask is here to help you find the frog(🐸) in your to-do list(📃) and get it done as fast(⚡) as possible.

## To-do's

- [ ] Improve UI.
- [ ] Add more themes.
- [ ] Improve code readability.

## Ideas

- Add some sort of alert if the user doesn't finish a task in time?
